## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [✅ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ✔] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ✔] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [✔ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [✔ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I have received some errors so I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52909830/typeerror-cannot-read-property-classlist-of-null
   https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?

One thing that was challenging for me was when I faced some errors while programming, but I fixed them. Also I come from a Java background so learning Javascript and using some of JS was a bit challenging for me, but i quickly got the hang of it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?

I am curious like how much can you do with web development, and if these are the features basics needed to create a simple game, I wonder how much can a person do with frameworks like react and express JS. Its fascinating to think about like how much technology has evolved over the past few years. Also how do the different fields of Computer Science correlate with each other, like is there overlap, for example Data Science and AI, does that also mix in with front end.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.

If i had more time, I would try and do more features, like from the optional ones. Adding more optional features.
